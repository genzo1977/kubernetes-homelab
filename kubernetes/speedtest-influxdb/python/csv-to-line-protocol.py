# Convert CSV data to Line Protocol.
# See https://github.com/lisenet/kubernetes-homelab

# I was previously running speedtest-cli with "--csv" flag and
# storing results in MySQL. Needless to say MySQL was overkill.
# Now that I have moved on InfluxDB, I wanted to migrate existing
# speedtest data from MySQL to InfluxDB. I did this by converting
# CSV data to Line Protocol that is used by InfluxDB to write data points.

# CVS data looks like this:
#
# Server ID,Sponsor,Server Name,Timestamp,Distance,Ping,Download,Upload,Share,IP Address

# Line Protocol is a text-based format that provides the measurement,
# tag set, field set, and timestamp of a data point.
